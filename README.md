# Process Composition Diagrams in Haskell

This repository contains a Haskell tool for visualising process compositions as diagrams.
The formal theory of process compositions is available on the [Archive of Formal Proofs](https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/ProcessComposition.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pilif0/isa-ProcessComposition).
This tool uses [code](https://github.com/pilif0/codegen-ProcessComposition) automatically generated from that formalisation by Isabelle/HOL.

The diagrams themselves are drawn using the [Diagrams](https://diagrams.github.io/) library and are geared towards being exported as SVG.

See the [`examples`](examples) directory for simple diagrams generated by this tool.
These examples are generated by an [executable](diagram/examples/Main.hs) of this project.

## Building

This project requires [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) to build.
Simply run `stack build` in the root to gather all dependencies, build them and build this project.

## Running

This project includes a single executable called `examples`, which generates a number of basic examples into a directory.
This can be run with `stack run DIR` where `DIR` is the destination directory.
